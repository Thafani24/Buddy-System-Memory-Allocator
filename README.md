# Buddy-System-Memory-Allocator

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Buddy System, a dynamic memory allocation technique used to efficiently manage memory blocks.  

## Overview  

The Buddy System minimizes fragmentation by splitting and merging memory blocks into sizes that are powers of 2. This project demonstrates memory allocation, deallocation, and visualization.  

### Features  
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Handles memory requests of varying sizes.  
- **Block Splitting:** Divides larger blocks to fit the request size.  
- **Buddy Merging:** Combines adjacent free blocks to create larger blocks.  
- **Visualization:** Displays memory status after each operation.
